****BYFRON: FUCK WE'RE DOOMED****

*Why is Byfron bad?*

- You've probably heard of 'Online Daters'
- Due to Byfron being released, everything is now leaved to Roblox Moderation
- BUT Roblox Moderation is the worst Moderation ever!
- They react to racist jokes, racism but not Online Dating
- Before Byfron Exploiters (in this case a little bit of hacker) could make Online Daters leave
- Byfron might be good for 'good' and 'better' gameplay
- But thats not entirely true
- Without Exploiters ruining your game, you don't have any fun
- Besides there are thousands of servers not infested with Exploiters
- Let's think about 4 years in the future
- You're bored and you decide to play Roblox
- You don't know which game to play so you decide to play Murder Mystery 2
- There are no Exploiters, just normal gameplay
- After 4 rounds of playing the Server starts getting empty
- 4 More Rounds you say to yourself
- You leave 1 minute right after you said that
- You join another game
- No Exploiters
- You're bored and play Minecraft

You get my point. Roblox starts losing players due to boredom; it's all the same.
So Roblox **please** consider changing your mind.
Some Exploiters might be bad but they're only continuing to do it if you help them to (saying things to them in the chat, etc.).

I have doubts Roblox will be the same without exploiters.
